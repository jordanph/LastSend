# Last Sender

Site: http://last-send.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/

A basic little game written for the Vechain blockchain network

The rules:

- The game starts out with 0 VET and an endtime of 1000 blocks
- Everytime a person sends to the contract, the amount is added to the pool
- If the block counter reaches 0 and you were the last sender, you win!
- However, be warned, the block counter is reset to 1000 everytime someone send their VET!
